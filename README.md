# 📚 Literacy Analysis in India

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of **literacy rates across India**, exploring regional disparities, gender gaps, and socio-economic influences. Through data visualization and statistical insights, it aims to support efforts in improving education and literacy policies.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goals of the project are to:
- Analyze literacy rates across Indian states and union territories.
- Identify gaps based on gender, region, and rural-urban distribution.
- Visualize and interpret key trends to support policy recommendations.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data analysis and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes literacy-related data across Indian states/UTs and possibly includes:
- State/UT Name
- Population demographics (Total, Male, Female)
- Literacy Rate (Total, Male, Female)
- Rural vs Urban division (if applicable)

> Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing text, and converting data types.

## 📊 Key Analyses

- State-wise literacy rate comparison
- Gender-based literacy gap analysis
- Rural vs Urban literacy trends
- Identification of top and bottom-performing regions
- Correlation of literacy with other socio-economic indicators (if included)

## 📌 Insights

- Southern and northeastern states show higher literacy rates compared to others.
- A significant gender gap still exists in several northern and rural areas.
- Urban regions consistently show better literacy outcomes than rural ones.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Insight Extraction for Policy Suggestions
